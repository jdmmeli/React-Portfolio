            <h4 className="text">Front-end web developer who uses previous experiences of working in a team to effectively collaborate with team members to achieve the desired outcome of a project. A recent graduate of the University of Richmondâ€™s Coding Bootcamp, where I earned a Certificate in Full Stack Development and developed skills in CSS, Javascript, and React.js. A dedicated worker who has held two jobs at once in the past, I view challenges not as obstacles, but as opportunities to learn and further the development of my skills. I worked on a four person team to develop  a MERN app that is a forum where users can create a profile, create posts on topics, comment on posts, and upload images. I look forward to using my experience as part of a quality-driven team to help shape a better user experience on the web.</h4>
